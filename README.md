# Amazon-Prime-Dashboard
📊 This dynamic dashboard is related to the Amazon Prime Video. It showcases the different business insights that one can gain. The data used while preparing this dashboard was taken from kaggle datasets. First of all, I invested time in data cleaning, transformation and modelling using Power Query Editor in Power BI.

🗂️ I also used slicers to make my dashboard really interactive, which enables seamless data exploration and analysis.
